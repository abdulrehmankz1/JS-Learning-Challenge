// Objects in JavaScript:
// Definition: An object in JavaScript is a collection of key-value pairs.
// Each key (also called a property) has a value, which can be any type of data
// (number, string, array, another object, or even a function). Objects are useful
// for storing and managing data in a structured way.

// Object Creation:
// You can create an object by using curly braces {} and defining key-value pairs inside.

// Creating an object
let person = {
    name: "Abdul Rehman",
    age: 25,
    city: "Karachi"
};

console.log(person);
