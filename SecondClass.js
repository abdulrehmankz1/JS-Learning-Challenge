let subtraction = a - b;
console.log("Subtraction: ", subtraction); 

let multiplication = a * b; 
console.log("Multiplication: ", multiplication); 

let division = a / b; 
console.log("Division: ", division);

let modulus = a % b;
console.log("Modulus: ", modulus);

let exponentiation = a ** b;
console.log("Exponentiation: ", exponentiation);


// 2. Assignment Operators
// Definition: Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables
//  They can also perform operations while assigning a value.
