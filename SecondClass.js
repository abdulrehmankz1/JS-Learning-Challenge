// Operators in JavaScript
// Operator: An operator is a special symbol used to perform operations on one, two, or three operands,
//  resulting in a value.Operators are essential for manipulating data and variables in JavaScript.


// 1. Arithmetic Operators
// Definition: Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical calculations such as addition,
//  subtraction, multiplication, and division.

let a = 10;
let b = 5;

let addition = a + b; 
console.log("Addition: ", addition);

let subtraction = a - b;
console.log("Subtraction: ", subtraction); 

let multiplication = a * b; 
console.log("Multiplication: ", multiplication); 

let division = a / b; 
console.log("Division: ", division);

let modulus = a % b;
console.log("Modulus: ", modulus);

let exponentiation = a ** b;
console.log("Exponentiation: ", exponentiation);


// 2. Assignment Operators
// Definition: Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables
//  They can also perform operations while assigning a value.

let x = 10;

x += 5;
console.log("Addition Assignment (x += 5): ", x);

x -= 3;
console.log("Subtraction Assignment (x -= 3): ", x);

x *= 2; 
console.log("Multiplication Assignment (x *= 2): ", x); 

x /= 4;
console.log("Division Assignment (x /= 4): ", x);

x %= 5;
console.log("Modulus Assignment (x %= 5): ", x); 

x **= 3; 
console.log("Exponentiation Assignment (x **= 3): ", x);
